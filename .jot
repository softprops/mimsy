multiget* values are empty ONLY after a keys value is update. why?

its not cool unless its consitently hashed. make use of vbucket and provide a hash interace to multiple remove connections

sys.error is probably not the nicest choice in the long term but it'll do for now. revisit this later

so what does serversocket.configureBlocking(false) really buy us? revisit this

heyo! how about some tests?

sasl installation on osx is anything but simple, need to test and dev this in an env where sasl actually works. 2.1.23 seems busted
